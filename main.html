  				<p class="read-more-wrap card-text">I’m going to say no. I’ve tried using two different Nikon cameras for astrophotography, the D3000 and the D5000. While the 5300 is somewhat better than both of these, there are still reasons I would not recommend it.
  				<br><br>
				First, DSLR’s in general are not ideal for astrophotography (AP). That said, many are used, and used well. <span class="read-more-target"><br><br>
				However, they are far noiser than astronomical CCD systems (signal noise, not audible noise), tend to be far less sensitive, and not designed for this kind of imaging. Furthermore, with the exception of three specific models (the Canon 20DA, Canon 60DA, and Nikon D810A), all DSLR’s come with a built-in IR-cutoff filter that’s installed directly over the CCD or CMOS imaging sensor.
				<br><br>
				This filter has two jobs. Its placement over the sensor provides protection for the imaging sensor. But it’s primary job is to block most near-IR wavelengths. For conventional imaging, this is necessary. Without the filter, you end up with pictures with an overly pink-red cast to them. This can be partly cleaned up with color balancing, but really requires the filter for best result. But there’s a LOT of astronomically interesting light at these wavelengths. Nearly any time you see the color red in a nebula you are seeing hydrogen emitting photons at around 656.2 nanometers - a wavelength known as hydrogen alpha. The built-in filters in most cameras cut the VAST majority of this out. You can take longer exposures and get more of it, but realistically you’ll never get good images of h-alpha without removing the sensor (and voiding your warranty!). Removing this sensor is not easy and probably not something you’d want to do yourself unless you’re an expert at camera repair. There’s a lot of tiny parts and very fragile pieces and doing this wrong can easily ruin the unit. There are services out there who will do it for you for a price, but then you’re left with a camera that’s really not ideal for conventional photography. You CAN get a screw-on version of that filter to replace the one that’s removed, but that adds to the price (and they’re not easy to find last I looked). Even if you have a modified DSLR, they’re typically not nearly as sensitive as an astronomical CCD. In this case, the D5300 is really not as bad as most DSLR’s, with a peak Quantum Efficiency (QE) of about 55% (meaning about 55% of the photons hitting the sensor register a signal). I have a CCD with a similar QE, but a good CCD will have a QE in the 75%+ range (and I’ve seen some in the mid 90’s). Lower QE means longer exposure times.
				<br><br>
				But, for me, the number one reason NOT to use a D5300 is because it’s a Nikon. I think Nikon makes great cameras, and I think their image quality is a bit better than Canon’s. But Nikon has been fairly reticent to assist the astrophotography community while Canon has done a lot to embrace it. Canon released two pre-modified models (the previously mentioned 20DA and 60DA) before Nikon released the D810A for astronomy. Canon has also provided a LOT of information and even released firmware source code in the past to assist modifiers (modification still voids your warranty, but at least they’ve been friendly enough to make information available). You will find a LOT more software on the market for computer-control of a Canon camera for astronomy than you will for a Nikon camera, and there’s a lot more processing software with Canon cameras in mind. As a personal anecdote, I once contacted Nikon support to try to get some information on the pixel layout of my D5000. I had been scouring the internet to find the specifics. I could find the same kind of information about pretty much every Canon DSLR, but not for Nikon. When I contacted Nikon they told me that information was proprietary and that was that. That’s when I decided it was time to find a pre-owned, pre-modified Canon DSLR. I’ve been quite happy with my 350D.
				<br><br>

				Can you use the D5300 for AP? Yes. But I really cannot recommend it.</span></p>
